# Aside  - Cors

When working with AJAX and JavaScript, it's common to encounter Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors. CORS is a security measure that prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. Here are a few methods to handle this issue:

1. **Use CORS Headers**: If you have control over the server, add appropriate CORS headers there. Here's an example of how you might set it up in an Express.js server:

```jsx
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
  next();
});

```

1. **Use a Proxy**: If you don't have control over the server, you may need to use a proxy. You can set up your own proxy server, or use an existing one.

Please note, these methods should be used as per your project's security guidelines and requirements.
