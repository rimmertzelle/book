HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, structures the content on the web. It's composed of several elements which represent different parts of a webpage. Here's a brief summary of the main structural elements:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Specifies the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: The root element that contains all other HTML elements.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document such as its title and links to its scripts and CSS files.
- `<title>`: Specifies the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the main content of the webpage, such as text, images, and links.
- `<header>`: Represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
- `<nav>`: Contains navigation links.
- `<main>`: Contains the main content unique to a document or application.
- `<footer>`: Contains information about the author, copyright information, etc.
- `<section>`: Represents a standalone section of a document, and usually contains a heading.
- `<article>`: Represents an independent piece of content of a document, such as a blog entry or newspaper article.
- `<aside>`: Contains content that is only indirectly related to the main content.
- `<details>` and `<summary>`: Used to create an interactive widget that the user can open or close.
